# Looker Tornado Chart Visualisation
This is a basic [Tornado chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_diagram) custom visualisation for [Looker](https://www.looker.com/), using Looker's [custom visualisation API](https://github.com/looker-open-source/custom_visualizations_v2/), written/provided by [scdata](https://www.scdata.co).

## Installation
To install this visualisation on your Looker instance, go to the visualisations admin page at `[youlookerinstance]/admin/visualizations` and enter [https://scdataco.github.io/looker-tornado-d3/looker_tornado_chart.js](https://scdataco.github.io/looker-tornado-d3/looker_tornado_chart.js) for the 'main' URL. Under dependencies, enter [https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js](https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js) to ensure that d3 is loaded alongside the main JavaScript file.

Choose a suitable ID e.g. `tornado_chart` and a label e.g. `ðŸŒª Tornado` to show to users when they pick a visualisation.

## Status/known issues
- currently in alpha status, so use at your own risk. Looker custom visualisations are loaded in a sandboxed iFrame so there *should* be minimal or no chance of this breaking anything beyond the visualisation not loading or working properly, but this cannot be guaranteed
- works with results made up of one visible dimension, one visible pivot and the first visible measure/measure-like calculation.
- errors if there are no pivots/dimensions/measures in the query
- settings are available for bar colours and showing/hiding x scale
- x scale doesn't respect value formats
- drill menus when clicking bars
- probably various other things to improve/fix/add
